-If you want to replay the game re-run it 
-The program was built in linux enviroment 
-Its need quite more improvements to run perfectly 
-The program uses only 2 windows the original for the run and another one which is hosting the game 
-You can see the tips on how to play Potter adventures while playing
-You can always see in which round you are and whats your score below the map 
-While trying to write the score(int) in the bin file, the program terminates with Seg Fault , thats why if you head to HiScore, at Score2Binary there is a line in comments.
-While playing, better be in fullscreen for your better experience
